\section{Comments}

\subsection{a)}

\begin{minted}[linenos, bgcolor = bg, breaklines]{cpp}
/* Initialize the variable a
    a = 0;
/* Set the minimum size */
    min = 100;
\end{minted}

The first comment in the "program" is never closed, meaning
that the variable a is never reached. In to be able to reach and use the variable
a, the comment needs to be closed similarly with a `` /* '' at the end of line 1
similar the second comment in line 3.

\textbf{Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Readability and understanding of code
    \item Comment out larger portions of code at once
    \item Generating documentation
    \item Selection between several possible implementation-specifc behaviours
    \item Specify structured information about methods
\end{itemize}

Here are five advantages regarding comments. where the two first bullets are fairly selfexplanetory.

Generating code documentation from comments can be an advantage if youu're working on large projects.
Where providing documentation yourself can be a big and time comsuming project in itself. Knowing how
to use eg. XML comments can be a benneficial factor in reducing an otherwise and potential
time comsuming task by "automating" the process of documentation generation to some extend. Ofcourse
it is not a 100\% automation, the XML still needs to be done by the programmer. 

\begin{minted}[linenos, bgcolor = bg, breaklines]{cpp}
    /// <summary>
    ///
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="id"> your id </param>
    /// <returns> </returns>
    public string GetUsername (int id) {
        return "username";
    }
\end{minted}
This would generate documentation for the function "GetUsername" using XML comments
\\

\emph{Pragmas} are comments used to give directives to the compiler which in other words
are implementation-specific behaviours. These comments are used to make the compiler do certain things
when compiling the a program. eg. this could be for the compiler to add something to the list
of library dependencies, debugging information or likewise.

\begin{minted}[linenos, bgcolor = bg, breaklines]{cpp}
    #pragma comment(lib, libname)
\end{minted}
tells the linker to add the 'libname' library to the list of library dependencies.
\\
\\

\begin{minted}[linenos, bgcolor = bg, breaklines]{java}
    /**
     * <p> This is a simple discription </p>
     * @param a an integer
     * @param b an integer
     * @return the sum of the two integers
     */
    public class Main {
        static void sum(int a, int b) {
            sum = a + b;
            return sum;
        }
    }
\end{minted}
The "comment" is usually called a "doc comment" and is used to automatically generate documentation for
eg. functions in java.

\textbf{Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Risk of making code unreachable
    \item Cluttering code 
\end{itemize}
some of the disadvantages are as follows

\begin{minted}[linenos, bgcolor = bg, breaklines]{cpp}
    /* Initialize the variable a
        a = 0;

    \end{minted}

Reusing the given example, one of the disadvantages of comment is the risk of making code unreachable
as in this example. Since the comment i never closed.
\\
\\
\begin{minted}[linenos, bgcolor = bg, breaklines]{python}
    def __PCA(data):
        
        # Creating "clone" of matrix
        data_cent = np.full_like(data,0) 
        # Iterate the matrix subtracting the mean diatiom from each row
        for i in range(4):
            data_cent[:,i] = trainingFeatures[:,i] - np.mean(trainingFeatures, 1)
        data_cent = data_cent.T
        #data_cent = data - mean_diatom.shape
        cov2 = np.cov(data_cent)
        #cov_matrix = np.cov(data_cent)
        #PCevals, PCevecs = np.linalg.eigh(cov2)
        PCevals, PCevecs = np.linalg.eig(cov2)
        #PCevals, PCevecs = np.linalg.eigh(cov_matrix)
        #PCevals = np.flip(PCevals, axis=0)
        #PCevecs = np.flip(PCevecs, axis=0)
\end{minted}
looking at this python code, we can see that the code has a lot of comments. Not all comments are helpful
to other programmers as, some of the comments are actuall code which as been commented out. This makes the
code harder for other to understand since it's not clear what is supposed to be "used/reused" and what are 
acutall comments for what the method does.
