\section{Comments}

\subsection{a)}

\begin{minted}[linenos, bgcolor = bg, breaklines]{cpp}
/* Initialize the variable a
    a = 0;
/* Set the minimum size */
    min = 100;
\end{minted}

The first comment in the "program" is never closed, meaning
that the variable a is never reached. In to be able to reach and use the variable
a, the comment needs to be closed similarly with a `` /* '' at the end of line 1
similar the second comment in line 3.
