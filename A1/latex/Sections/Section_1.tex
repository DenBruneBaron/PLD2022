\begin{lstlisting}
                (($\lambda$x . (x x)) ($\lambda$x . (x x)))
\end{lstlisting}

The above term is what I believe we call the "omega program" or "omega combinator" $\Omega$.
This specific program does not terminate when we use beta-reduciton on it.
in fact, it reduces to itself.

\begin{lstlisting}
                (($\lambda$x . (x x)) ($\lambda$x . (x x)))
                            $\xdownarrow{0.8cm}$ $\beta$-reduction 
                (($\lambda$x . (x x)) ($\lambda$x . (x x)))
                            $\xdownarrow{0.8cm}$ $\beta$-reduction 
                (($\lambda$x . (x x)) ($\lambda$x . (x x)))
\end{lstlisting}

This reduction can go on and on. The term is the samllest nonterminating program
and is the basis for building out loops with lambda calculus if not other metod
is presented.
