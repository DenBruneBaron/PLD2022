\section{Control structures}

In our book, Prolang theres a specific line that I've been thinking about and trying to
find more information about. It says \emph{The ALGOL 60 report does not forbid the loop body to modify i}\footnote{p. 138, Prolang}
If it is possible for the body of a loop to modify the counter, it could be possible to end ud with an infinite loop. By either
resetting the value of the counter inside the body of the loop, in which case the loop would never terminate since a 
desired condition might never be reached.
