\section{Garbage collection}
I've chosen to use a freelist in order to make the Garbage collection. I know
that Torben wanted the implementation done differently, where the freelist is
implemented directly on to the heap (As far as i understood from the lecture where
he talked about this). I havn't been able to complete the task in this manner, however
the program should still work, but maybe suboptimalt compared to what it could.

see the .zip files that have been uploaded with the report.

I've compiled the program with the following commands on my Ubuntu 20.04 LTE system,
but it might be different on a different system.

\begin{verbatim}
    gcc -c my_free_list.c
    gcc -c GC.c
    gcc my_free_list.o GC.o -o garbcol
\end{verbatim}

which will give an executable file that can be executed with

\begin{verbatim}
    ./garbcol
\end{verbatim}
