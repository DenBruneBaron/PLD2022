ORIGINAL CODE SNIPPET:

let rec bizarre b q =
    let mango z = b
    in
        if b then ( bizarre false mango )
            else ( mango 17 , q 17 );;

let dummy = function x -> false
let bongo = bizarre true dummy;;


STEP 1) Rename every function so it has a unique name:

let rec bizarre b q =
    let mango z = b
    in
        if b then ( bizarre false mango )
            else ( mango 17 , q 17 );;

let dummy = function x -> false
let bongo = bizarre true dummy;;



STEP 1, it is possible to skip step one of the algorithm, since all functions
are "unique" in the sence that there's no dublicates of functionnames that are
considered another function than the original.

STEP 2)
