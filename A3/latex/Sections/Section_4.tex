\subsection{a)}
Root and mixed are two different functions.
Root creates a the that has a root at X with either zero, two or three children.
Mixed is a function that checks whether the tree created by the root function is
a mixed tree. And will possibly return a boolean value if the tree created by root
is or is not indeed a mixed tree.

\subsection{b)}
\begin{verbatim}
    Root("gorilla",
        Root("goat",
            Root("duck",
                Root("koala"), Root("manatee")
            )
            Root("impala")
        )
        Root("horse"), Root("ostrich")
    )
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{c)}
Creating a method called: leftmost

I have the following.

\begin{verbatim}
    letmost(Root(E),E).
    leftmost(Root(_, T1, _), E) :- leftmost(T1, E).
    leftmost(Root(_, T1, _, _), E) :- leftmost(T1, E).
\end{verbatim}
