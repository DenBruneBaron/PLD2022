\section{A3.6}
Older programming languages like Fortran-77 had the possibility for dynamic scoping
with static type checking.

One possible solution would be to have variables declared in a specific
manner. This could be done by having the different types only use certain
variables.

An example of this could be.
Integers taking the variables of: i, j, k , l, m, n
Doubles taking the variables of: d, h, v, x

and so on. Note that these variables given above are just an example.
